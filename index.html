      <p>Two of the biggest and my favorite esports is CSGO and Call of Duty. CSGO
        is a computer game while Call of duty is a console PS4 based game. They
        both have some similarities but also are completely different in gameplay
        and playstyle. Both have players and teams people support as loyal as any
        other sport fan would do and thats what makes these esports great. I will
        go in more detail about these two esports on this website.
