     <p>Counter strike is an attack and deffend game revlolved around timing
     and skill to win. The team who reaches 16 rounds first is the winner.
     The game is mainly played on a computer and is made by the company valve.
     This is  a classic game like LOL and DOTA were it does not change every year
     like call of duty. The only thing that changes is the graphics and when their is
     gun balancing updates the way the gun kill shoots and kills changes but that is rare.
     All of this is what makes csgo a game people have played for years and will
     continue to play for many years to come.

    <p> in the competitive scene players and teams compete and train for hours
      to get their name out there and hopfully one day compete for a major team
      or creat a major team of their own. These players come from all over the world
      and that makes the competition to get into a good team hard. A lot of people fail
      but for those who dont are guaranteed a salary and fame. historically, the
      best teams in the world come from european countries like sweeden and germany.
      Teams based in the US historicly dont dominate the scene which makes being
      succesfull as a NA pro nearly impossible. Most recently a team from brazil
      has been making some noise team Illuminosity (now SK gaming ) has won the past two majors
      and look to continue their run stronger than ever maybe de throwning the
      dynasty team of finatic as most succesful team in counter strike. look  below
    for a video and a list of teams. </p>
